Before running and compiling, go to the first line inside the `main()` function and copy the path to your desired textfile.

Then, run the `make` command to compile the file, and follow it with `./maze` to run the program.

If the path to the textfile exists and is correct, the program will run, print the message "sucessfully written to file" and create `output.txt` which will contain the path found.
